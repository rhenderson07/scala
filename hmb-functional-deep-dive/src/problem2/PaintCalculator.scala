/**
 * Sometimes you have to round up to the next number rather than follow standard rounding rules.
 * Calculate gallons of paint needed to paint the ceiling of a room. Prompt for the length and
 * width, and assume one gallon covers 350 square feet. Display the number of gallons needed to
 * paint the ceiling as a whole number.
 *
 * Challenges:
 * 1) Revise the program to ensure that inputs are entered as numeric values. Donâ€™t allow the
 * user to proceed if the value entered is not numeric.
 * 
 * 2) Implement support for a round room.
 * 3) Implement support for an L-shaped room.
 * 4) Implement a mobile version of this app so it can be used at the hardware store.
