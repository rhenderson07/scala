/**
 * Sometimes you have to perform a more complex calculation based on some provided inputs and then
 * use that result to make a determination.
 *
 * Create a program that prompts for your weight, gender, and number of drinks, the amount of
 * alcohol by volume of the drinks consumed, and the amount of time since your last drink.
 * Calculate your blood alcohol content (BAC) using this formula.
 *
 * Challenges:
 * 1) Handle metric units.
 *
 * 2)	Look up the legal BAC limit by state and prompt for the state. Display a message that
 * states whether or not itâ€™s legal to drive based on the computed BAC.
 *
 * 3) Develop this as a mobile application that makes it easy to record each drink, updating the
 * BAC each time a drink is entered.
