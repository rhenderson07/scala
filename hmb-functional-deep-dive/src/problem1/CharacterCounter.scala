/**
 * Create a program that prompts for an input string and displays output that shows the input
 * string and the number of characters the string contains.
 *
 *  Challenges:
 * 1) If the user enters nothing, state that the user must enter something into the program.
 *
 * 2) Implement this program using a graphical user interface and update the character counter
 * every time a key is pressed. If your language doesnâ€™t have a particularly friendly GUI
 * library, try doing this exercise with HTML and JavaScript instead.
 *
 * Extra Credit:
 * 1) Count the number of characters from: http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11.txt
